Ha! The stars laugh againoh, how they love this one! You are meant for greatness, for the world shall *bow* before your genius... at least, thats what *I* like to tell people. But beware of ambitiondont get so caught up in your dreams that you forget to, you know, *eat* or *sleep*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">career</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How to succeed? Follow your passion, yes, yes! But make sure its something profitable, like... oh, I dont know... selling *mystical* crystals. Yes, thats where the *real* money is. Collaboration is keyjust be sure they don't take all the credit while you do all the work!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">career</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When, you ask? Well, the cards say it will happen when you stop questioning everything and start acting. But dont worry, doubt is *normal*except when it gets in the way of success. So... hurry up and make a decision!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">career</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will you succeed? The stars say... well, maybe in a *creative* field? Like a professional *fortune teller*? But no, thats just me. The cards show something big, though*a very big thing*just not *exactly* what or where.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">health</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, health... a topic I could talk about for *hours*but Ill spare you. The Strength card tells me you have the power to overcome obstacles, but*and its a big but*dont be too eager to ignore your bodys complaints. Youll regret it when you pull your back *picking up a sock*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">health</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How to improve health? Well, the High Priestess says... meditation, of course! But not just any meditation. You have to do it while balancing on one leg and chanting the alphabet backward. Oh, and dont forget a *green smoothie*!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">health</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why focus on health? The Fool card says... because if you dont, youll eventually turn into a *couch potato* with a *really* bad back. And, honestly, do you want that? Do you? The Empress card is *nodding*take care of your body so you dont end up living on a giant inflatable chair!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">health</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will you improve? The cards say... oh, soon, I guess. But remember, gradual improvements! Its like planting a *tiny* treedont expect a forest in one day. Also, avoid stress eatingunless its really delicious!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">money</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, money! The Ace of Pentacles says you will have money, yes. But... dont expect it to come from a *rich uncle* or a surprise inheritance from a *distant relative*. Invest wisely, perhaps in some *sparkly* stones from my collection. Or, you know, maybe try *Bitcoin*if you understand it, that is.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">money</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How to get money? The Wheel of Fortune spins ever in your favorbut watch out! It might flip right when youre about to hit *payday*. Side hustle! Think about starting a mystery-solving business. Its *so* lucrative!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">money</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why money? The cards say its a toola *very useful* tool. You can buy food, you can buy books, or you can buy another *reading* from me! Choices, choices, choices...'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">success</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, success, the *dream*! The Star card tells me youre on the verge of something bigprobably not *right now*, but definitely... sometime. Perhaps after you solve a puzzle, or figure out why youve been wearing mismatched socks.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">success</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How to achieve success? The Chariot card saysmove forward with determination, but also a little *caution*. Dont ride that chariot too fast, or youll end up in a *ditch*. But, hey, youll learn something from that too!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">success</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why success? The cards say its a test of your *inner strength*but, really, its about making sure you dont run out of money before the end of the month. So, plan ahead*plan for anything*! You might need a second job!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">success</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will success arrive? Well, the Wheel of Fortune says soon, but dont expect the *fairy tale* ending. Its more like a *slow clap* from the universe. Your victory will be subtle, but sweetlike a perfectly toasted marshmallow.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">success</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will success take you? The cards are vague on that, but probably *not* where youre expecting. Maybe an *unexpected* trip to the grocery store? Or perhaps youll succeed at finally assembling your IKEA furniture!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">palm</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, your palm! The lines are telling me somethingwait, theyre fuzzy! I can see that you will experience some *extreme* changes soon... or is that just leftover spaghetti on my hand? Hmm, only time will tell.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">palm</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How do I know so much about your palm? EasyIve seen thousands of palms, each one revealing *secrets*. For just $99.99, I can give you a *detailed report* on every line, every mark, and every warning. Its the *ultimate* service!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">palm</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will this be revealed? Hmmm, well, time is money, darling. I can say it'll happen *soon*, but a more precise reading will require a one-on-one session. You know*for the right price*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">palm</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will your destiny unfold? Its in the palm! Maybe in your kitchen? Or behind the couch where you keep losing your keys? Honestly, its always the places you least expect!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">death</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Death? Oh, my dear, it's just a metaphor! Like when you accidentally delete a file. But this? It's not about dyingit's about moving to the next level of existence. And by level, I mean your weekend plans.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">death</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why death, you ask? Because, my dear, its *the* universal reset button. Sometimes you have to toss out your old shoes before you can buy new ones. Or maybe you just need to stop texting your ex.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">death</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will your transformation happen? According to this card, its probably around the time your phone battery dies unexpectedly. Thats when you know big changes are coming!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">death</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will this transformation occur? Its a place close to you, but slightly inconvenientlike a DMV or a laundromat. *Thats* where the change will hit. Fate loves a good twist!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">horoscope</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, the stars are *whispering* about your future! Right now, Venus is making an angry face at Jupiter, so be careful with *everything*. Your love life may be a bit 'meh' today, but its okay. Thats what wine is for.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">horoscope</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How do I know your horoscope? Well, Ive studied the stars, and I *might* have a special app that gives me all the cosmic gossip. But dont worry, it's mostly accurate! 30% of the time.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">horoscope</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why should you care about horoscopes? Because, my dear, the stars *always* know. Or they dont. But they can make you feel better about that awful meeting you have later today!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">horoscope</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When should you act on your horoscope? Its always a good idea to follow your star signsunless Mercurys in retrograde, then just sit tight and maybe eat some chips. The stars will forgive you.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">horoscope</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will the stars guide you? Lets see& maybe to a café with really bad WiFi. Or possibly the last aisle of the grocery store when you run out of toilet paper. Thats where your destiny awaits!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fate</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, fate! It's all about timing, and Im *the one* who can help you unlock it. Want a sneak peek? For just $299.99, I can provide you with a customized fate reading that will blow your mind. Act now before its too late!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fate</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How does fate work? Well, darling, fate works best when you *pay* to understand it. I can decode your entire fate story, but only if you invest in a *premium* package. Just $199.99, and its all yours!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fate</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why is fate important? Because you *cant* avoid itunless, of course, you get my Ultimate Fate Package, which will help you *guide* fate instead of letting it control you. Only $249.99lets make fate work for you!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fate</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will fate catch up with you? Oh, the stars are a bit tricky today, but for only $99.99, I can give you an exact date. Youll never be caught unprepared again!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">fate</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where will fate take you? Lets just say you could *really* use my exclusive VIP Fate Reading for $149.99, which will pinpoint your *exact* location of successno guessing required.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">past</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, your past? Lets just say its full of *untapped* potential. The Six of Cups tells me that you were once a prodigy of some sort. Maybe. But now? Youre just trying to avoid any more awkward encounters. And lucky for you, for only $79.99, I can unlock those hidden secrets for you. *Imagine* how powerful your future could be with this knowledge!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">past</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How does your past affect you? Simple, darling: it holds all the *clues* to your future, and the best way to unlock them is to book a private session with me. For just $150, Ill guide you through all those *crucial* moments.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">past</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why does the past linger? Because its like that one sweater you cant seem to throw away*it keeps coming back*. The Justice card says its time for a bit of a tidy-up, dont you think?'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">past</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will your past stop affecting you? Oh, I can tell you*but* for a small fee. A session with me will cost you $99.99, but its worth every penny, as Ill reveal exactly when your past will be *overcome*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">past</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where does your past live? Probably in your old school yearbook, or in the back of your mind whenever someone mentions *that one ex*. Let it go, but not too fast.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">present</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'The present moment is like the *perfect* cup of coffeehot, fleeting, and easily spilled. The Sun card tells me to enjoy it, but watch out for those spills. They could happen at any time.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">present</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How to live in the present? The Magician advises: do what you *can* do right now. The universe is about instant gratificationunless youre waiting for a package. Then its patience, my friend.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">present</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why focus on now? Because if you keep looking ahead, youll miss the *great* snack you just made. The Emperor card tells you that mastering today builds a better tomorrow. Dont miss out on nachos!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">present</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When should you act? Now, of course! Unless youre in line at a coffee shop or waiting for an important call. Then, maybe just wait a second.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">present</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where is the present happening? Right here, right now. Except for when youre thinking about that email you forgot to send. But youre still in the presentyou can *fix it* later.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cost</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, the cost of things? Darling, everything has a price, especially when you're as *special* as you. The Ten of Pentacles suggests that wealth is yours for the taking, but dont forget*theres always a price*. For just $99.99, Ill reveal how to get it without working too hard.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cost</span>&quot; how &quot;<span class="quote">'How much will it cost? Oh, sweetheart, cost is subjective. You can pay for the *quick version*, or you can wait and *struggle*. But Ill tell you this: if you want to skip the line, the special fee is just $149.99. Trust me, its worth it.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cost</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why is cost so important? *Simple*, darlingbecause time is money, and Im here to help you save both. Youll pay *less* for the insights you need right now with my Premium Package, priced at just $199.99. Think of it as an *investment* in your future success!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cost</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will it be worth it? Oh, soon! Very soon... but if you want to speed things up and get the *fast track* version, I can personally guide you through itjust $99.99 for the expedited process! We both know you dont want to wait.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">cost</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where can you find out the real cost of things? Not just the *monetary* cost, darling. No, the emotional and spiritual cost can only be understood through my *exclusive* one-on-one consultation. For only $179.99, Ill tell you everything you need to know.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">love</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, love!' the Fortune Teller exclaims with a knowing smile. 'Its like a *sale* at the local department store, isnt it? You *never* know when its going to happen, but suddenlypoof! Theres someone, perhaps someone with a *credit card* youll eventually regret, or maybe a *beautiful soul*though probably not. Keep your hopes... well, *moderately low*. It will come, though, eventually... probably.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">love</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why love? Ah, thats the *million-dollar* question, isnt it? The stars say its a cosmic *joke*. You try, you fail, you get distracted by social media and then*bam*! Love sneaks in when you least expect it, like a late-night pizza delivery. But honestly, I wouldn't count on the pizza being *hot*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">love</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will it happen, you ask? Oh, soon, very soon. Im feeling it... *perhaps* after you stop swiping on dating apps for the 47th time today? Maybe after you upgrade your wardrobe or get a new haircut. Trust me, timing is everythingbut mostly, it's just about lowering your standards.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">love</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where, you ask? The stars tell me *everywhere*. You might find love in a dark corner of the coffee shop or perhaps in a *parking lot* near your old gym. Love is a *sneaky* thing; it doesnt need to announce itself with trumpetsmore like a coupon code you forgot about.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hate</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, hate! Its a powerful feeling, isnt it? As reliable as the weather and just about as pleasant. The stars tell me someone will come into your life soon who will inspire a *special kind* of loathing, perhaps a *neighbor*, or someone at work who insists on *talking about the weather* too much. But dont worry, dear, I *charge* for this kind of reading.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hate</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why hate? Because the universe enjoys a little *chaos*. It thrives on drama, especially when you least expect it. Your hater might even be someone you trustedperhaps someone who *still owes you money* or, worse, borrowed your favorite pen and never returned it. The stars know. Oh, they know.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hate</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will it come, you ask? Soon, very soon, like a *discount sale* you didnt even know about. It will hit you unexpectedly, probably when you're in a *rush* and someone cuts you off in traffic. Timing is everything, but dont worry, it's coming with a *money-back guarantee*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">hate</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where, you ask? Somewhere inconvenient, like during a *public* event, perhaps while youre waiting for your *order at the coffee shop* to be wrong. The universe knows just how to place those irritantslike a puzzle, but its a puzzle that you *never* finish.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">friendship</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Friendship, ah yes, the *treasure* we all seek! Its like finding a rare collectible at a yard saleunexpected, delightful, and often followed by a *disappointing amount of paperwork* later. But youll find it, surely. Maybe in a *library* or perhaps when youre *borrowing someones charger*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">friendship</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why friendship, you ask? Because the stars say... we need each other*sometimes*. And who knows? Maybe youll meet someone wholl lend you money when you *forget your wallet* at a bar, or at least someone who *shares memes* with you on a weekly basis. Either way, its *lucky*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">friendship</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will you meet a friend? Thats the real question, isnt it? The stars suggest it could be soon, maybe when you least expect it. Or maybe right after you *finally stop ghosting* people. But dont get your hopes up. Timing is unpredictable, like *discount flights*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">friendship</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where? Well, anywhere, but probably when youre stuck *waiting for a delayed bus* or maybe at a *coffee shop* where someone *accidentally* spills a latte on your lap. Fate, you see, likes to play *tricks* like that.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">relationship</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, relationships! Theyre like contracts you *dont remember signing*. The stars say one will form soonpossibly with someone who *doesnt understand your sarcasm* or maybe with someone whose *texting habits* drive you crazy. Oh, but love! Love! Youll make it work, right? Its all about lowering expectations and raising *your credit score*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">relationship</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why a relationship? Ah, well, the stars say it's *natures way* of keeping us distracted. Youll meet someone and think, *'This is it!'* But the truth is, relationships are like subscriptionsthey *seem* great at first, but by the third month, youll wonder what happened to the *free trial*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">relationship</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will you be in a relationship? Well, that depends on *several factors*. When you finally get tired of swiping left? When your cat stops interrupting your Zoom calls? Or maybe itll happen right after you buy a new *outfit*trust me, *new clothes always help*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">relationship</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where? Oh, anywhere! The stars suggest a *grocery store* or maybe when you least expect itlike in a *parking lot* after you get a flat tire. Relationships pop up when your guard is *down*, especially after an unflattering *selfie* you accidentally sent to someone.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">family</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Ah, familythe people who *borrow* your things and then forget where they put them. Youll be spending time with them soon, perhaps during a *holiday* or maybe at a *reunion* where *awkward silence* fills the air. Expect a *return of unwanted advice* about your life choices!'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">family</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why family? Well, lets face itfamilies are *destined* to complicate things. Theyre your *built-in* drama network, keeping you entertained with *life choices* that *arent your business*. Just smile and nod. Thats all you need to do.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">family</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When? Soon, soon, my dear. The stars suggest it will be just after you *promise to attend one more family event* you really dont want to go to. Expect the call, probably from Aunt Barbara, asking if youve *lost weight* or found someone to settle down with.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">family</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where, you ask? Oh, anywhere! Likely at a *dinner table* filled with everyone talking over each other. Or maybe in the *living room*, when someones *playing with the remote control* and no one can agree on what to watch.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">loss</span>&quot; what &quot;<span class="quote">'Loss, my dear, is as inevitable as a *bad hair day* in the morning. But worry not, for after this moment of sadness, *someone* will offer you a tissue and a *half-hearted apology*. Its the circle of lifeor as I call it, a *circle of extra tissues*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">loss</span>&quot; why &quot;<span class="quote">'Why loss? Because life is just a *huge* game of hide and seek. You lose things. You lose people. But sometimes you gain something more valuable in returnlike the *last donut* in the breakroom. You *cant* win them all, but at least the donuts are *worth it*.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">loss</span>&quot; when &quot;<span class="quote">'When will this loss occur? Oh, soon, my dearperhaps after you misplace your *favorite sock* or forget to *set an alarm*. The universe, you see, is a *mysterious* thing, but it always returns in the most inconvenient ways.'</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">&quot;<span class="quote">loss</span>&quot; where &quot;<span class="quote">'Where? Oh, it could be anywhere.

Theres a curious mix of mysticism and... something else. A few posters on the walls boast services like 'Love and Fortune Readings' and 'Astrology for the Modern Seeker,' but the paper is starting to peel at the edges. On top of all the posters is the label 'Mystical Wonders'. On a nearby table, you spot a tarot card spread and crystal ball. You mightve seen some of the items at the dollar store last week.

She flicks them back up with a practiced gesture, only to adjust them again a moment later. Her expression is one of deep concentration, as if shes trying to decide whether to ask you about your energy field or if youre just here for the $10 special. A thick necklace of glittery stones jangles as she leans forward, her hands waving dramatically toward the crystal ball, which seems to be glowing a bit too brightly for something mystically ancient. She pauses for a moment, then leans in conspiratorially: 'You know, Im really good at this.

His voice has a weary edge to it, as if hes dealt with one too many strange occurrences in this neighborhood.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Chapter 6 - Interrogative Values</p><p class="indent0">Interrogative is a kind of value. <span class="comment">[For the Fortune Teller &amp; Detective]</span></p><p class="indent0">The interrogatives are who, what, when, where, how, and why.</p><p class="indent0">Current question is an interrogative that varies.</p><p class="indent0">After asking the Detective about something:</p><p class="indent1">respond to the question.</p><p class="indent0">After answering the Detective that something:</p><p class="indent1">respond to the question.</p><p class="indent0">After asking the Fortune Teller about something:</p><p class="indent0">    respond to the question.</p><p class="indent0">After answering the Fortune Teller that something:</p><p class="indent0">    respond to the question.</p><p class="indent2"></p><p class="indent0">After telling the Fortune Teller about something:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Youve come to seek wisdom from the stars, not to share your own revelations.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After reading a command:</p><p class="indent1">if the player's command includes &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">interrogative</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;:</p><p class="indent2">now the current question is the interrogative understood.</p><p class="indent0">To respond to the question:</p><p class="indent1">repeat through the Table of Detective Responses:</p><p class="indent2">if the topic understood includes query entry:</p><p class="indent3">if the current question is the question type entry:</p><p class="indent4">say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">reply entry</span><span class="quote">][</span><span class="substitution">paragraph break</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent4">rule succeeds;</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The Detective looks at you for a moment, sizing you up.
